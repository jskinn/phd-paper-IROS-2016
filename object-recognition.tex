\subsection{Object Recognition}

% TODO: Write/edit the rest of this when/if I have object recognition results.

To demonstrate the wide applicability of high-fidelity simulation to computer vision research, we also generated datasets to test a object recognition algorithm. (TODO: find out what algorithm Niko is using, a paper about it and provide a brief description).

To test the algorithm. We generated datests by capturing images of a mug at $5\degree$ vertical and horizontal angle increments at a fixed radius. The mug was placed in a near-featureless white void and was captured with an without a surface underneath. Angles that were occluded by the base surface were omitted. This lets us test the orientation independence of the place recognition, to see if there is a certain, expected orientation for a mug to be recognised.

% TODO: Some comment on the performance

Having discovered particular angles at which the algorithm exhibits poor performance, we can improve that performance by generating additional training data for these angles.
