abstract = {In this paper we use the algorithm SeqSLAM to address the question, how little and what quality of visual information is needed to localize along a familiar route? We conduct a comprehensive investigation of place recognition performance on seven datasets while varying image resolution (primarily 1 to 512 pixel images), pixel bit depth, field of view, motion blur, image compression and matching sequence length. Results confirm that place recognition using single images or short image sequences is poor, but improves to match or exceed current benchmarks as the matching sequence length increases. We then present place recognition results from two experiments where low-quality imagery is directly caused by sensor limitations; in one, place recognition is achieved along an unlit mountain road by using noisy, long-exposure blurred images, and in the other, two single pixel light sensors are used to localize in an indoor environment. We also show failure modes caused by pose variance and sequence aliasing, and discuss ways in which they may be overcome. By showing how place recognition along a route is feasible even with severely degraded image sequences, we hope to provoke a re-examination of how we develop and test future localization and mapping systems.},

abstract = {Current SLAM back-ends are based on least squares optimization and thus are not robust against outliers like data association errors and false positive loop closure detections. Our paper presents and evaluates a robust back-end formulation for SLAM using switchable constraints. Instead of proposing yet another appearance-based data association technique, our system is able to recognize and reject outliers during the optimization. This is achieved by making the topology of the underlying factor graph representation subject to the optimization instead of keeping it fixed. The evaluation shows that the approach can deal with up to 1000 false positive loop closure constraints on various datasets. This largely increases the robustness of the overall SLAM system and closes a gap between the sensor-driven front-end and the back-end optimizers.},

abstract = {Place recognition has long been an incompletely solved problem in that all approaches involve significant com- promises. Current methods address many but never all of the critical challenges of place recognition – viewpoint-invariance, condition-invariance and minimizing training requirements. Here we present an approach that adapts state-of-the-art object proposal techniques to identify potential landmarks within an image for place recognition. We use the astonishing power of convolutional neural network features to identify matching landmark proposals between images to perform place recognition over extreme appearance and viewpoint variations. Our system does not require any form of training, all components are generic enough to be used off-the-shelf.We present a range of challenging experiments in varied viewpoint and environmental conditions. We demonstrate superior performance to current state-of-the- art techniques. Furthermore, by building on existing and widely used recognition frameworks, this approach provides a highly compatible place recognition system with the potential for easy integration of other techniques such as object detection and semantic scene interpretation.},

The topological graph is built on top of a graph SLAM system, which can be efficiently optimized even for very large environments. The novel feature of our system is that it navigates locally using local metric maps, while the overall plan is formed on the topological graph. Unlike many current SLAM methods, we never reconstruct a full occupancy grid of the environment for localization or path planning. We show that our method generates near-optimal plans, and deals gracefully with changes to the map.},

We also show, by quantifying the failure rate over long video sequences, that the bundle adjustment is able to significantly decrease the rate of gross failures in the camera tracking. Thus, bundle adjustment does not only bring accuracy improvements. The accuracy improvements also suppress error buildup in a way that is crucial for the performance of the camera tracker. Our experimental study is performed in the setting of tracking the trajectory a calibrated camera moving in 3D for various types of motion, showing that bundle adjustment should be considered an important component for a state-of-the-art real-time camera tracking system.},

Sequence-based SLAM (or SeqSLAM for short) makes use of the image descriptors extracted from a series of consecutive frames and matching is done between two such image sequences. It has been shown to be effective in dealing with significant illumination change where localization and mapping can be conducted under different time periods and weather conditions. To address the computational issue that can arise from the exhaustive search of the candidate sequences with the increase of map size, we use a particle filter to implement the Bayes filtering framework of estimating the true match. The resampling of the particles allows us to maintain only a small number of hypotheses while still capturing the true distribution of the robot location. Our method is highly scalable and efficient, validated on a large dataset with comparable results to the original algorithm in terms of performance.},

abstract = {While the most accurate solution to off-line structure from motion (SFM) problems is undoubtedly to extract as much correspondence information as possible and perform global optimisation, sequential methods suitable for live video streams must approximate this to fit within fixed computational bounds. Two quite different approaches to real-time SFM - also called monocular SLAM (Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping) - have proven successful, but they sparsify the problem in different ways. Filtering methods marginalise out past poses and summarise the information gained over time with a probability distribution. Keyframe methods retain the optimisation approach of global bundle adjustment, but computationally must select only a small number of past frames to process. In this paper we perform the first rigorous analysis of the relative advantages of filtering and sparse optimisation for sequential monocular SLAM. A series of experiments in simulation as well using a real image SLAM system were performed by means of covariance propagation and Monte Carlo methods, and comparisons made using a combined cost/accuracy measure. With some well-discussed reservations, we conclude that while filtering may have a niche in systems with low processing resources, in most modern applications keyframe optimisation gives the most accuracy per unit of computing time.},

abstract = {In RGB-D sensor based visual odometry the goal is to estimate a sequence of camera movements using image and/or range measurements. Direct methods solve the problem by minimizing intensity error. In this work a depth map obtained from a RGB-D sensor is considered as a new measurement which is combined with a direct photometric cost function. The minimization of the bi-objective cost function produces 3D camera motion parameters which registers two 3D surfaces within a same coordinate system. The given formulation does not require any predetermined temporal correspondencies nor feature extraction when having a sufficient frame rate. It is shown how incorporating the depth measurement robustifies the cost function in case of insufficient texture information and non-Lambertian surfaces. Finally the method is demonstrated in the Planetary Robotics Vision Ground Processing (PRoVisG) competition where visual odometry and 3D reconstruction results are solved for a stereo image sequence captured using a Mars rover.},

Precise and high frame-rate motion estimation brings increased robustness in scenes of little, repetitive, and high-frequency texture.

abstract = {This article presents a novel scale- and rotation-invariant detector and descriptor, coined SURF (Speeded-Up Robust Features). SURF approximates or even outperforms previously proposed schemes with respect to repeatability, distinctiveness, and robustness, yet can be computed and compared much faster. This is achieved by relying on integral images for image convolutions; by building on the strengths of the leading existing detectors and descriptors (specifically, using a Hessian matrix-based measure for the detector, and a distribution-based descriptor); and by simplifying these methods to the essential. This leads to a combination of novel detection, description, and matching steps. The paper encompasses a detailed description of the detector and descriptor and then explores the effects of the most important parameters. We conclude the article with SURF’s application to two challenging, yet converse goals: camera calibration as a special case of image registration, and object recognition. Our experiments underline SURF’s usefulness in a broad range of topics in computer vision.},

In this paper, we propose an extension of this work by integrating metrical information from robot odometry in the topological map, so as to obtain a globally consistent environment model.

A survival of the fittest strategy that selects the points and keyframes of the reconstruction leads to excellent robustness and generates a compact and trackable map that only grows if the scene content changes, allowing lifelong operation.

SLAM is an essential task for the autonomy of a robot. Nowadays, the problem of SLAM is considered solved when range sensors such as lasers or sonar are used to built 2D maps of small static environments. However SLAM for dynamic, complex and large scale environments, using vision as the sole external sensor, is an active area of research. The computer vision techniques employed in visual SLAM, such as detection, description and matching of salient features, image recognition and retrieval, among others, are still susceptible of improvement.

abstract = {This paper is about localising across extreme lighting and weather conditions. We depart from the traditional point-feature-based approach as matching under dramatic appearance changes is a brittle and hard thing. Point feature detectors are fixed and rigid procedures which pass over an image examining small, low-level structure such as corners or blobs. They apply the same criteria applied all images of all places. This paper takes a contrary view and asks what is possible if instead we learn a bespoke detector for every place. Our localisation task then turns into curating a large bank of spatially indexed detectors and we show that this yields vastly superior performance in terms of robustness in exchange for a reduced but tolerable metric precision. We present an unsupervised system that produces broad-region detectors for distinctive visual elements, called scene signatures, which can be associated across almost all appearance changes. We show, using 21km of data collected over a period of 3 months, that our system is capable of producing metric localisation estimates from night-to-day or summer-to-winter conditions.},

Point features are matched between pairs of frames and linked into image trajectories at video rate. Robust estimates of the camera motion are then produced from the feature tracks using a geometric hypothesize-and-test architecture. This generates what we call visual odometry, i.e. motion estimates from visual input alone. No prior knowledge of the scene nor the motion is necessary. The visual odometry can also be used in conjunction with information from other sources such as GPS, inertia sensors, wheel encoders, etc. The pose estimation method has been applied successfully to video from aerial, automotive and handheld platforms.

abstract = {The challenge of persistent appearance-based navigation and mapping is to develop an autonomous robotic vision system that can simultaneously localize, map and navigate over the lifetime of the robot. However, the computation time and memory requirements of current appearance-based methods typically scale not only with the size of the environment but also with the operation time of the platform; also, repeated revisits to locations will develop multiple competing representations which reduce recall performance. In this paper we present a solution to the persistent localization, mapping and global path planning problem in the context of a delivery robot in an office environment over a one-week period. Using a graphical appearance-based SLAM algorithm, CAT-Graph, we demonstrate constant time and memory loop closure detection with minimal degradation during repeated revisits to locations, along with topological path planning that improves over time without using a global metric representation. We compare the localization performance of CAT-Graph to openFABMAP, an appearance-only SLAM algorithm, and the path planning performance to occupancy-grid based metric SLAM. We discuss the limitations of the algorithm with regard to environment change over time and illustrate how the topological graph representation can be coupled with local movement behaviors for persistent autonomous robot navigation.},

In this paper we present a novel feature-based monocular SLAM system that is more robust, gives more accurate camera poses, and obtains comparable or better semi-dense reconstructions than the current state of the art. Our semi-dense mapping operates over keyframes, optimized by local bundle adjustment, allowing to obtain accurate triangulations from wide baselines. Our novel method to search correspondences, the measurement fusion and the inter-keyframe depth consistency tests allow to obtain clean reconstructions with very few outliers. Against the current trend in direct SLAM, our experiments show that by decoupling the semi-dense reconstruction from the trajectory computation, the results obtained are better.

The optimal sequence alignment, which can be viewed as a discontinuous path through the matrix, is found using a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) framework reminiscent of Dynamic Time Warping from speech recognition. The state transitions enforce local velocity constraints and the most likely path sequence is recovered efficiently using the Viterbi algorithm.

The optimization can be difficult, due to poor initial estimates arising from odometry data, and due to the size of the state space. We present a fast non-linear optimization algorithm that rapidly recovers the robot trajectory, even when given a poor initial estimate.

The mobile robot performs range sensing with a unique omnidirectional stereovision system, estimates its motion using visual odometry and detects loop closures via a place recognition system as it performs topological map building and localization concurrently. Owing to the importance of performing loop closing regularly, the mobile robot is equipped with an active loop closure detection and validation system that assists it to return to target loop closing locations, validates ambiguous loop closures and provides it with the ability to overturn the decision of an incorrectly committed loop closure. A refined incremental probabilistic framework for an appearance-based place recognition system is fully described and the final system is validated in multiple experiments conducted in indoor, semioutdoor and outdoor environments. Lastly, the performance of the probabilistic framework is compared with the rank-based framework with additional experiments conducted in the semi-autonomous mode, where the mobile robot, provided with a priori information in the form of a topological map that is built in a separate occasion in an offline manner, is required to reach its target destination.},

Large textureless regions, usually found in indoor and urban environments, are difficult to reconstruct by these systems.

We propose a novel scheme for superpixel matching, 3D initialization and optimization that overcomes the difficulties of salient point-based approaches in these areas of homogeneous texture. Our experimental results show the validity of our approach. First, we compare our proposal with a state-of-the-art multiview stereo system; being able to reconstruct the textureless regions that the latest cannot. Secondly, we present experimental results of our algorithm integrated with the point-based PTAM [1]; estimating, now in real-time, the superpixel textureless areas. Finally, we show the accuracy of the presented algorithm with a quantitative analysis of the estimation error.},

Linear image features are extracted using a Principal Component Analysis. The appearance model is represented as a probability density function of the image feature vector given the location of the robot. We estimate this density model from the data with a kernel estimation method. We show how the parameters of the model influence the localization performance.

In this paper, we present the results of several years of work on an integrated system to localize a mobile robot in rough outdoor terrain using visual odometry, with an increasing degree of precision. We discuss issues that are important for realtime, high-precision performance: choice of features, matching strategies, incremental bundle adjustment, and filtering with inertial measurement sensors. Using data with ground truth from an RTK GPS system, we show experimentally that our algorithms can track motion, in off-road terrain, over distances of 10 km, with an error of less than 10 m (0.1{\%}).},

The object is represented by a set of viewpoint invariant region descriptors so that recognition can proceed successfully despite changes in viewpoint, illumination and partial occlusion. The temporal continuity of the video within a shot is used to track the regions in order to reject unstable regions and reduce the effects of noise in the descriptors. The analogy with text retrieval is in the implementation where matches on descriptors are pre-computed (using vector quantization), and inverted file systems and document rankings are used. The result is that retrieved is immediate, returning a ranked list of key frames/shots in the manner of Google. The method is illustrated for matching in two full length feature films.},

The core SLAM system, dubbed RatSLAM, is based on computational models of the rodent hip- pocampus, and is coupled with a lightweight vision system that provides odometry and appearance information. RatSLAM builds a map in an online manner, driving loop closure and relocaliza- tion through sequences of familiar visual scenes. Visual ambiguity is managed by maintaining multiple competing vehicle pose esti- mates,while cumulative errors in odometry are correctedafter loop closure by a map correction algorithm.We demonstrate the map- ping performance of the system on a 66 km car journey through a complex suburban road network. Using only a web camera oper- ating at 10 Hz, RatSLAM generates a coherent map of the entire environment at real-time speed, correctly closing more than 51 loops of up to 5 km in length.},

abstract = {Learning and then recognizing a route, whether travelled during the day or at night, in clear or inclement weather, and in summer or winter is a challenging task for state of the art algorithms in computer vision and robotics. In this paper, we present a new approach to visual navigation under changing conditions dubbed SeqSLAM. Instead of calculating the single location most likely given a current image, our approach calculates the best candidate matching location within every local navigation sequence. Localization is then achieved by recognizing coherent sequences of these “local best matches”. This approach removes the need for global matching performance by the vision front-end - instead it must only pick the best match within any short sequence of images. The approach is applicable over environment changes that render traditional feature-based techniques ineffective. Using two car-mounted camera datasets we demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm and compare it to one of the most successful feature-based SLAM algorithms, FAB-MAP. The perceptual change in the datasets is extreme; repeated traverses through environments during the day and then in the middle of the night, at times separated by months or years and in opposite seasons, and in clear weather and extremely heavy rain. While the feature-based method fails, the sequence-based algorithm is able to match trajectory segments at 100{\%} precision with recall rates of up to 60{\%}.},

We propose to split tracking and mapping into two separate tasks, processed in parallel threads on a dual-core computer: one thread deals with the task of robustly tracking erratic hand-held motion, while the other produces a 3D map of point features from previously observed video frames. This allows the use of computationally expensive batch optimisation techniques not usually associated with real-time operation: The result is a system that produces detailed maps with thousands of landmarks which can be tracked at frame-rate, with an accuracy and robustness rivalling that of state-of-the-art model-based systems.},

Application domains include robotics, wearable computing, augmented reality, and automotive. The term VO was coined in 2004 by Nister in his landmark paper. The term was chosen for its similarity to wheel odometry, which incrementally estimates the motion of a vehicle by integrating the number of turns of its wheels over time. Likewise, VO operates by incrementally estimating the pose of the vehicle through examination of the changes that motion induces on the images of its onboard cameras. For VO to work effectively, there should be sufficient illumination in the environment and a static scene with enough texture to allow apparent motion to be extracted. Furthermore, consecutive frames should be captured by ensuring that they have sufficient scene overlap.},

It allows to benefit from the simplicity and accuracy of dense tracking - which does not depend on visual features - while running in real-time on a CPU. The key idea is to continuously estimate a semi-dense inverse depth map for the current frame, which in turn is used to track the motion of the camera using dense image alignment. More specifically, we estimate the depth of all pixels which have a non-negligible image gradient. Each estimate is represented as a Gaussian probability distribution over the inverse depth. We propagate this information over time, and update it with new measurements as new images arrive. In terms of tracking accuracy and computational speed, the proposed method compares favorably to both state-of-the-art dense and feature-based visual odometry and SLAM algorithms. As our method runs in real-time on a CPU, it is of large practical value for robotics and augmented reality applications.},

The scheme builds upon popular techniques of indexing descriptors extracted from local regions, and is robust to background clutter and occlusion. The local region descriptors are hierarchically quantized in a vocabulary tree. The vocabulary tree allows a larger and more discriminatory vocabulary to be used efficiently, which we show experimentally leads to a dramatic improvement in retrieval quality. The most significant property of the scheme is that the tree directly defines the quantization. The quantization and the indexing are therefore fully integrated, essentially being one and the same.

abstract = {Many animals learn to follow habitual routes between important locations, but how they encode their routes is still largely unknown. Desert ants traveling between their nest and a food site develop stable, visually guided routes that can wind through desert scrub without the use of trail pheromones. Their route memories are sufficiently robust that if a nest-bound ant is caught at the end of its route and replaced somewhere earlier along it, the ant will recapitulate the route from the release site. Insects appear to use panoramas to recognize when they are on a familiar route. I examine here the cues then used for their guidance. Several mechanisms are known for straight segments of a route; but how does an ant encode a curved route along which both the views it sees, and the directions it takes, are constantly changing? The results here suggest that when an ant travels past a landmark on a familiar route, it uses the gradually changing direction of the landmark to trigger a set of associated learned heading directions. A route through a complex 2D environment could thus be encoded and followed economically if it is divided into panorama-defined segments, with each segment controlled by such a 1D mapping. The solution proposed for the ants would be simple to implement in an autonomous robot.},

The scalability of the   system is achieved by defining a sparse approximation to the FAB-MAP model suitable for implementation using an inverted index.

At the core is a   method for precise segmentation of range data into planar segments based on the algorithm of scan-line grouping extended to cope with the noise dynamics of stereo vision. In off-line   experiments we demonstrate that our extensions achieve a more precise segmentation. When compared to a previously developed patch-let method, we  obtain a richer segmentation with a higher accuracy while also requiring far less computations. From the obtained segmentation we then build a 3D environment map using occupancy grid and floor height maps.   The resulting representation classifies areas into one of six different types while also providing object height information.

By using a fused volumetric surface reconstruction we achieve a much higher quality map over what would be achieved using raw RGB-D point clouds. In this paper we highlight three key techniques associated with applying a volumetric fusion-based mapping system to the SLAM problem in real time. First, the use of a GPU-based 3D cyclical buffer trick to efficiently extend dense every-frame volumetric fusion of depth maps to function over an unbounded spatial region. Second, overcoming camera pose estimation limitations in a wide variety of environments by combining both dense geometric and photometric camera pose constraints. Third, efficiently updating the dense map according to place recognition and subsequent loop closure constraints by the use of an  as-rigid-as-possible' space deformation. We present results on a wide variety of aspects of the system and show through evaluation on de facto standard RGB-D benchmarks that our system performs strongly in terms of trajectory estimation, map quality and computational performance in comparison to other state-of-the-art systems.},

abstract = {Simultaneous Localisation And Mapping (SLAM) methods provide real-time estimation of 3D models from the sole input of a hand-held camera, routinely in mobile robotics scenarios. Medical endoscopic sequences mimic a robotic scenario in which a hand-held camera (monocular endoscope) moves along an unknown trajectory while observing an unknown cavity. However, the feasibility and accuracy of SLAM methods have not been extensively validated with human in-vivo image sequences. In this work, we propose a monocular visual SLAM algorithm tailored to deal with medical image sequences in order to provide an up-to-scale 3D map of the observed cavity and the endoscope trajectory at frame rate. The algorithm is validated over synthetic data and human in-vivo sequences corresponding to fifteen laparoscopic hernioplasties where accurate ground-truth distances are available. It can be concluded that the proposed procedure is: 1) non invasive, because only a standard monocular endoscope and a surgical tool are used; 2) convenient, because only a handcontrolled exploratory motion is needed; 3) fast, because the algorithm provides the 3D map and the trajectory in real time; 4) accurate, because it has been validated with respect to groundtruth; and 5) robust to inter-patient variability, because it has performed successfully over the validation sequences.},

A specialisation of the algorithm to recover structure and camera position modulo an affine transformation is described, together with a method to periodically update the affine coordinate frame to prevent drift over time. We describe the constraint used to obtain this specialisation. Structure is recovered from image corners detected and matched automatically and reliably in real image sequences. Results are shown for reference objects and indoor environments, and accuracy of recovered structure is fully evaluated and compared for a number of reconstruction schemes. A specific application of the work is demonstrated—affine structure is used to compute free space maps enabling navigation through unstructured environments and avoidance of obstacles.

In this paper we add an important extra dimension to the approach. We explicitly model the spatial distribution of visual words as a random graph in which nodes are visual words and edges are distributions over distances. Care is taken to ensure that the spatial model is able to capture the multi-modal distributions of inter-word spacing and account for sensor errors both in word detection and distances. Crucially, these inter-word distances are viewpoint invariant and collectively constitute strong place signatures and hence the impact of using both spatial and visual appearance is marked.

abstract = {We address the problem of simultaneous localization and mapping by combining visual loop-closure detection with metrical information given by the robot odometry. The proposed algorithm builds in real-time topo-metric maps of an unknown environment, with a monocular or omnidirectional camera and odometry gathered by motors encoders. A dedicated improved version of our previous work on purely appearance-based loop-closure detection [1] is used to extract potential loop-closure locations. Potential locations are then verified and classified using a new validation stage. The main contributions we bring are the generalization of the validation method for the use of monocular and omnidirectional camera with the removal of the camera calibration stage, the inclusion of an odometry-based evolution model in the Bayesian filter which improves accuracy and responsiveness, and the addition of a consistent metric position estimation. This new SLAM method does not require any calibration or learning stage (i.e. no a priori information about environment). It is therefore fully incremental and generates maps usable for global localization and planned navigation. This algorithm is moreover well suited for remote processing and can be used on toy robots with very small computational power.},

@article{Davison2007,
abstract = {We present a real-time algorithm which can recover the 3D trajectory of a monocular camera, moving rapidly through a previously unknown scene. Our system, which we dub MonoSLAM, is the first successful application of the SLAM methodology from mobile robotics to the "pure vision" domain of a single uncontrolled camera, achieving real time but drift-free performance inaccessible to Structure from Motion approaches. The core of the approach is the online creation of a sparse but persistent map of natural landmarks within a probabilistic framework. Our key novel contributions include an active approach to mapping and measurement, the use of a general motion model for smooth camera movement, and solutions for monocular feature initialization and feature orientation estimation. Together, these add up to an extremely efficient and robust algorithm which runs at 30 Hz with standard PC and camera hardware. This work extends the range of robotic systems in which SLAM can be usefully applied, but also opens up new areas. We present applications of MonoSLAM to real-time 3D localization and mapping for a high-performance full-size humanoid robot and live augmented reality with a hand-held camera.},

@article{CADENA,
abstract = {We propose a place recognition algorithm for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) systems using stereo cameras that considers both appearance and geometric information of points of interest in the images. Both near and far scene points provide information for the recognition process. Hypotheses about loop closings are generated using a fast appearance-only technique based on the bag-of-words (BoW) method. We propose several important improvements to BoWs that profit from the fact that, in this problem, images are provided in sequence. Loop closing candidates are evaluated using a novel normalized similarity score that measures similarity in the context of recent images in the sequence. In cases where similarity is not sufficiently clear, loop closing verification is carried out using a method based on conditional random fields (CRFs). We build on CRF matching with two main novelties: We use both image and 3-D geometric information, and we carry out inference on a minimum spanning tree (MST), instead of a densely connected graph. Our results show that MSTs provide an adequate representation of the problem, with the additional advantages that exact inference is possible and that the computational cost of the inference process is limited. We compare our system with the state of the art using visual indoor and outdoor data from three different locations and show that our system can attain at least full precision (no false positives) for a higher recall (fewer false negatives).},

abstract = {We describe a real-time, low-cost system to localize a mobile robot in outdoor environments. Our system relies on stereo vision to robustly estimate frame-to-frame motion in real time (also known as visual odometry). The motion estimation problem is formulated efficiently in the disparity space and results in accurate and robust estimates of the motion even for a small-baseline configuration. Our system uses inertial measurements to fill in motion estimates when visual odometry fails. This incremental motion is then fused with a low-cost GPS sensor using a Kalman filter to prevent long-term drifts. Experimental results are presented for outdoor localization in moderately sized environments (ges100 meters)},
