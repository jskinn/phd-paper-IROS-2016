abstract = {This paper presents USARSim, an open source high fidelity robot simulator that can be used both for research and education. USARSim offers many characteristics that differentiate it from most existing simulators. Most notably, it constitutes the simulation engine used to run the virtual robots competition within the Robocup initiative. We describe its general architecture, describe examples of utilization, and provide a comprehensive overview for those interested in robot simulations for education, research and competitions.},

abstract = {This paper describes the Player/Stage software tools applied to multi-robot, distributed-robot and sensor net- work systems. Player is a robot device server that pro- vides network transparent robot control. Player seeks to constrain controller design as little as possible; it is device independent, non-locking and language- and style-neutral. Stage is a lightweight, highly configurable robot simulator that supports large populations. Player/Stage is a commu- nity Free Software project. Current usage of Player and Stage is reviewed, and some interesting research opportu- nities opened up by this infrastructure are identified.},

@article{Koenig2004,
abstract = { Simulators have played a critical role in robotics research as tools for quick and efficient testing of new concepts, strategies, and algorithms. To date, most simulators have been restricted to 2D worlds, and few have matured to the point where they are both highly capable and easily adaptable. Gazebo is designed to fill this niche by creating a 3D dynamic multi-robot environment capable of recreating the complex worlds that would be encountered by the next generation of mobile robots. Its open source status, fine grained control, and high fidelity place Gazebo in a unique position to become more than just a stepping stone between the drawing board and real hardware: data visualization, simulation of remote environments, and even reverse engineering of blackbox systems are all possible applications. Gazebo is developed in cooperation with the Player and Stage projects (Gerkey, B. P., et al., July 2003), (Gerkey, B. P., et al., May 2001), (Vaughan, R. T., et al., Oct. 2003), and is available from http://playerstage.sourceforge.net/gazebo/ gazebo.html.},

@article{Milford2012,
abstract = {Learning and then recognizing a route, whether travelled during the day or at night, in clear or inclement weather, and in summer or winter is a challenging task for state of the art algorithms in computer vision and robotics. In this paper, we present a new approach to visual navigation under changing conditions dubbed SeqSLAM. Instead of calculating the single location most likely given a current image, our approach calculates the best candidate matching location within every local navigation sequence. Localization is then achieved by recognizing coherent sequences of these “local best matches”. This approach removes the need for global matching performance by the vision front-end - instead it must only pick the best match within any short sequence of images. The approach is applicable over environment changes that render traditional feature-based techniques ineffective. Using two car-mounted camera datasets we demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm and compare it to one of the most successful feature-based SLAM algorithms, FAB-MAP. The perceptual change in the datasets is extreme; repeated traverses through environments during the day and then in the middle of the night, at times separated by months or years and in opposite seasons, and in clear weather and extremely heavy rain. While the feature-based method fails, the sequence-based algorithm is able to match trajectory segments at 100{\%} precision with recall rates of up to 60{\%}.},
