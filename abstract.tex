Computer vision research has traditionally been limited by the need to capture and test algorithms using image data captured manually from the real world.
This results in a number of key limitations on the development and analysis of computer vision algorithims.
In this paper, we look at how these limitations can be addressed by using a high-fidelity simulation environment to generate image datasets.
To achieve this, we use an existing state of the art simulation tool, Unreal Engine 4 by Epic Games, to generate a variety of image datasets that are then used to evaluate a couple of current state-of-the-art place recognition algorithms at a granularity that was previously impossible.
The use of high-fidelity simulations opens up new opportunities for development and analysis of algorithms, without the added cost of capturing real-world datasets with which to test the algorithm under development.
